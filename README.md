## AgriMate

AgriMate is a comprehensive web application designed to empower farmers by providing a platform that predicts product prices, manages storage options, and offers actionable insights based on market conditions. The application integrates a Laravel-based backend with a Flask-powered machine learning model to forecast prices, helping farmers make informed decisions about when to sell or store their products.

Key Features:

Price Prediction: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict future prices of agricultural products, allowing farmers to optimize their selling strategies.
Storage Management: Displays nearby storage facilities using Google Maps API, helping farmers find the best storage options based on their location.
SMS Notifications: Automatically notifies farmers when the storage price of their products exceeds market prices, prompting them to take action.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers a simple and intuitive dashboard where farmers can log in, view predictions, manage their products, and receive alerts.
Technology Stack:

Backend: Laravel (PHP) for application logic, data management, and user interactions.
Machine Learning: Flask (Python) for serving the machine learning model used to predict product prices.
Database: MySQL for storing user data, product information, and prediction results.
Notifications: Twilio API for sending SMS alerts to farmers.
Maps Integration: Google Maps API to display nearby storage locations.
AgriMate aims to provide farmers with the insights they need to enhance their profitability and make informed decisions regarding their agricultural products.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
